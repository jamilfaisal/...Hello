# ...Hello
(30-3-2018) This is the second JavaFx Application I developed. 

The program's backend uses java's socket programming to allow two devices to communicate with each other.
The user is given the choice to host a local server or connect to another device through the ipv4 address.

The frontend is developed using JavaFx which includes many design options like emotes (both images and gifs) and different sounds that play on certain events.
